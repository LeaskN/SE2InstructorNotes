// FIZZ BUZZ
// FIZZ BUZZ is an (old) game where people count up from 0 and 
// Say fizz if the number is divisible by 3 and buzz if its divisible by 5 if both add fizzbuzz to the array, if none of these add back the original number
// For example counting to 15: 0, 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz
// Write a function that returns an array of numbers, fizz, buzz, & fizzbuzz counting up to a given number 
// Given 15 return [ 1, 2, fizz, 4, buzz, fizz, 7, 8, fizz, buzz, 11, fizz, 13, 14, fizzbuzz]
// Scenareos:
  // DIV by 3: Fizz
  // DIV by 5: Buzz
  // DIV by 3 or 5: FizzBuzz
  // DIV by neither: the number
