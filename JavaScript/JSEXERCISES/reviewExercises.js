// 1. given an array of names, get the middle person's initials
// 2. create a function which takes in a decimal and returns that number multiplied by 13 and then rounded UP to the next integer
// 3. create a function which takes in a string and removes the first, last, and middle letters
// 4. create a function which returns a random whole number between 25 & 50
// 5. Create a function which reverses the order of a word without using .reverse()
// 6. Create a function which takes in an array of words and reports which ones have the letter e
// 7. This is a continuous question:
    // 7.1: Creating an object
        // Create an object called house
            // Give it 3 key-value pairs including; size, county, and number of floors. 
        
    // 7.2: Changing Values
        // Using bracket notation 
            // 2a: Change the size of the house
        
            // 2b: Write code that dynamically increases the number of floors by one no matter the current number of floors
                // AKA 1 floor would give 2. 
                // 2 would give 3. 
                // 4 would give 5 etc...

    // 7.3: Adding Stuff
        // Add numberOfAdults as a key with a value of your choosing 
        // Add numberOfKids as a key with a value of your choosing

    // 7.4: Calculate (fake) cost
        // each person costs $10 
        // and your totalCost is size multiplied by the cost of all people
        // calculate the totalCost
                // add cost to your original house object
