  * In your words:
    * I plan to use twitter to experiment with some ideas that I have. I'd like to see what responses I can get from the API and use this information to help improve my design skills. I am also interested in how quickly I can get an API application up and running and I'd like to generally understand how much effort is included in working with a new API. So far I have only theorized working with front end code but I'm sure that I'd like to eventually work with analytics.
