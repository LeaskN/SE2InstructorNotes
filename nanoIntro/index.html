We ran the commands:
    `touch index.html` to create file called 'index.html'
    `nano index.html` to run nano on the file. Allowing us to edit it from within the CLI 
    Once done editing, we hit `control-x` to exit, `y` to save, and enter to fully exit
    We then ran `Open index.html` on Mac or `Start index.html` on Windows to view the file in the browser
